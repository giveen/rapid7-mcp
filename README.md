A unified MCP server for Rapid7's security platform — exposing [InsightVM](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightvm/) (vulnerability management), [InsightIDR](https://www.rapid7.com/products/insightidr/) (SIEM/investigations), [Automation (InsightConnect)](https://docs.rapid7.com/insightconnect/) (workflow automation), and [Metasploit Pro](https://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/) (pentest telemetry) as tools for Claude, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible LLM client.

Ask natural-language questions across your entire Rapid7 environment — vulnerabilities, active incidents, compromised hosts — and get structured answers without writing a single API call.

Built with [fastapi-mcp](https://github.com/tadata-ru/fastapi-mcp), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/).

> **No Rapid7 instance?** Set `DEMO_MODE=true` to explore all 26 tools against realistic fixture data. Clone, run, connect — no credentials required.

## What you can do

Once connected to Claude, you can ask things like:

> _"Which of my sites has the highest risk score?"_
> _"What are the critical vulnerabilities on the production web server, and is there already a remediation project for them?"_
> _"Is Log4Shell present anywhere in my environment? Show me the CVSS score and any available exploits."_
> _"Are there any open InsightIDR investigations right now? What's the highest priority one?"_
> _"Search our logs for any connections to this IP address: 185.220.101.1"_
> _"What active Metasploit sessions exist and what hosts were compromised?"_
> _"Give me a full security posture summary across sites, open incidents, and active sessions."_

The server translates these into API calls across InsightVM, InsightIDR, and Metasploit Pro and returns structured data that Claude can reason over, correlate, and summarize.

```

Every FastAPI route is automatically published as an MCP tool via `fastapi-mcp`. Operation IDs become tool names, Pydantic schemas become input/output schemas, and docstrings become tool descriptions.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/SecuritahGuy/rapid7-mcp.git
cd rapid7-mcp
uv sync

# 2. Configure (or skip and use DEMO_MODE)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your console URLs and credentials

# 3. Start the server
DEMO_MODE=true uv run uvicorn rapid7_mcp.main:app --port 8000
```

- MCP endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
- Interactive API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

---

## Connect to VS Code

Add `.vscode/mcp.json` to your workspace (already included in this repo):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "rapid7-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Start the server first (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → **Tasks: Run Task** → **Start MCP Server (Demo Mode)**), then connect in the Claude Code panel.

## Connect to Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rapid7": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Start the server first, then restart Claude Desktop.
